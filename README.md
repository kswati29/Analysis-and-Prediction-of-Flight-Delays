Analysis and Prediction of Flight Delays

This project report evaluates the effects of various attributes of a flight lifecycle (air journey from point A to B) towards the performance (on-time or delay). 
The report is data-backed with python based code employing exploratory analysis and modeling. 
The dataset used for analysis is of 2015 domestic airlines, USA to predict arrival delay.
Original Link for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays#flights.csv

The attributes are related to airlines, airports, timing/schedule, distance, flying process(taxi, wheel out, air time etc) and reasons of delay. 
Do some of these variables have a significant effect on delay? If so, which ones? What variables can be identified that predict delays? 
Since the study is data-backed, this summary is useful for both travellers and airlines to improve their decision process vis a vis flight time, expenses, marketing strategy etc. 
Linear regression method is used to investigate, with a particular level of accuracy, the predictors related significantly and their extent as influential contributors to the valuation of delay. 
Different statistical visualisations are created to observe the trends about the delays for coherent understanding.
